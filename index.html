            <p>The Bees Knees</p>
            <p>The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating
                from San Francisco, California. The band
                consists a dynamic lineup featuring two lead
                vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, a
                keyboardist and a drummer. The band
                achieved its first commercial success as an
                unsigned act, drawing attention from their
                future manager. Having extensive experience
                working with both new and seasoned acts, the
                manager was confident the band could
                succeed even further with more support,
                pushing The Bees Knees to sign with a well
                known record label.</p>
            <p>From there, the band has soared, gaining
                international recognition and ranking in the
                top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans
                immediately fell in love with the band’s original
                and organic attitude, solidifying their place as
                one of the hottest and fastest up and coming
                acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to
                themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn to
                their candid and authentic performances on
                stage. The Bees Knees are currently recording
                their second studio album, looking to be
                released in early 2024.</p>
